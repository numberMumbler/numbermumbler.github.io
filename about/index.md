I'm a senior-level software developer, working mostly on web sites and web services. Currently, my interest is in integrating AI and machine learning into mainstream, line-of-business applications. I'm also grinding my way through a Master's in CS at Georgia Tech.

If you stop me on the street and hand me a laptop, I could bang out code in any of the following languages:

- C#
- Python
- JavaScript
- Clojure
- Rust (well, not yet by hopefully soon)

Here's how to get ahold of me:
