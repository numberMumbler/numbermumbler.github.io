Hi. I'm a software developer with experience architecting and building web applications.

My background is pretty broad. I've spent time doing everything from requirements gathering to hardening servers to writing customer-facing documentation. I'm currently interested in integrating AI & Machine Learning into business applications.

Feel free to reach out if there's anything I can help you with.
