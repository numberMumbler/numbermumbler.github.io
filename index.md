Hi. I'm David Janke, and I solve difficult problems (typically by building software).

Check out my _new_ project:  
[🐌 Snail Snail 🐌](https://snailsnail.tech)

My background is pretty broad. Most of my experience is around web apps. I've spent time doing everything from requirements gathering to hardening servers to writing customer-facing documentation. I'm currently interested in integrating AI & Machine Learning into business applications.

Feel free to reach out if there's anything I can help you with.
